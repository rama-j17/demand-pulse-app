## Overview
DemandPulse utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms, particularly time-series forecasting techniques, to predict sales for a given period. It processes historical sales data, performs feature engineering, and trains a predictive model. The tool then provides actionable insights into stock, pricing, and promotions based on predicted demand. 

This project is intended for use by e-commerce platforms, retailers, or supply chain managers who aim to optimize their inventory and operations.

## Features
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predict future sales based on historical data.
- **Price and Promotion Optimization**: Suggest optimal pricing and promotional strategies based on predicted sales trends.
- **Seasonality Analysis**: Understand seasonal patterns in demand to adjust inventory and pricing.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Incorporate advanced time-series techniques to improve forecasting accuracy.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize sales trends and optimization recommendations via a web interface (Streamlit).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing for data operations.
- **XGBoost**: Machine learning algorithm for forecasting and regression tasks.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For pre-processing and model evaluation.
- **Prophet**: Used for time-series forecasting.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive dashboard.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Git**: Version control for project management.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DemandPulse.git
   cd DemandPulse
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

  ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
  ```
3. Install required dependencies:

  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. Data

  The dataset used in this project is a historical sales dataset with the following features:

  Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
  Order Date: Date when the order was placed.
  Ship Date: Date when the order was shipped.
  Product Name: Name of the product sold.
  Sales: The total sales amount for the order.
  Other Features: Customer ID, Segment, Region, etc.

  The dataset can be found in the data/ folder. Make sure to preprocess the data as shown in the code before feeding it into the model.

5. Model

  The model used for forecasting is an ensemble method utilizing XGBoost for regression. We apply time-series features and use Prophet for seasonality adjustments. The model is trained on historical sales data and then used to predict future sales.

  Hyperparameters:
  n_estimators: The number of boosting rounds for XGBoost.
  
  learning_rate: The step size used in the gradient descent.
  
  max_depth: Maximum depth of the trees.

6. Model Evaluation:

  The model is evaluated using metrics such as R² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure the model is performing effectively.

  Usage
  After setting up the project and installing dependencies, you can run the Streamlit app to interact with the model and visualize predictions.
  
  Run the Streamlit app:

  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
  
  This will launch a web interface where you can input parameters (such as time period) to get sales forecasts, optimization suggestions, and visualizations.

## Results
   The model has achieved an R² Score of 0.5876 on the test dataset, which demonstrates a moderate level of accuracy in sales prediction. This score can be further improved through hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
    
   Sample Results:
    
   Predicted Sales: Forecasted sales for the next quarter. 
   Optimization Suggestions: Suggested pricing and promotions based on predicted sales. 
   Seasonality Patterns: Visualized seasonal trends in demand.
